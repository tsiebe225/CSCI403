Some of the syntax differences based on what system was used could be a
 bit frustrating at times. But other than that it was more so just confirming that what was being done was correct using lots of select * to view the table and ensure the changes were what they should have been. Also the naming at times could be annoying, as it was frustrating figuring out what worked in my particular system vs other systems. But through trying and checking the results it was able to be figured out.
But it was a good project to figure out the ins and outs and how to use more funcationality and get more indepth with the subject matter.
This project took roughly 90 to 120 minutes.
